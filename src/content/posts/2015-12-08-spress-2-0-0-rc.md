We have now released the [first release candidate](/about/changelog/#2-0-0-rc) and, in theory, the unique release candidate.
This release contains some features and fixes.

## The highlight of this release

* A new data source called **MemoryDataSource** is available for generating dynamic content. An example is [available at developer documentation](/docs/developers/data-sources/#MemoryDataSource).
* Support to sort items at `PaginationGenerator` with attributes `sort_by` and `sort_type`. See [#61](https://github.com/spress/Spress/issues/61).
* Added `getGeneratorManager` method to `EnvironmentEvent` for managing generators at plugins.
* Improved the way of generating the classname in PluginGenerator (`new:plugin` command). e.g: a plugin named `yosymfony\hola-user` will generate a `YosymfonyHolaUser` class.
* Fixed the lifecycle: render phase starts after converter phase has been finished for all items.
