Hi community. I was working on Spress 2.3.0 whose only new feature would have been
the incremental site regeneration, an experimental feature that lets Spress to recompile
only the modified files in a site so it can save time and increments the performance.
From a year and some months ago I'm father and I don't have enough free time for all my
side projects so I have decided to focus my effors on Spress 3.0.0 ([master branch](https://github.com/spress/spress)).
This version will work over PHP 7.2 (minimum version) and Symfony 4. I'll keep
you update about all the new features and changes.
