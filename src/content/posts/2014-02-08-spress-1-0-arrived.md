After 3 *releases candidate*, the first stable version arrived. With this release you can
extend Spress with plugins and create themes that can be published at the
[add-ons](<{{ site.url }}/add-ons>) page (you only need to send a tweet to
[@spress_cms][url_spress_cms] or [@yosymfony][url_yosymfony]).

I'm starting to think in the new features of the next release and any suggestion
will be welcome. If you have some stuff, you can open a issue at
[Github page](https://github.com/yosymfony/Spress/issues).
