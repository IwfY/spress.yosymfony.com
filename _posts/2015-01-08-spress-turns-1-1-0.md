Spress just turned 1.1.0. This release comes seven months later of the last stable 1.0.3
with interesting new goodies. This release also marks the start of Spress 2 development.
Whatâ€™s changed in 1.1.0? Here are some highlights:

* **Two new scaffolding commands**: `new:post` and `new:plugin` for creating posts and plugin respectively. See the [blog post](/releases/2014/11/21/spress-1-1-0-beta-2-is-out/).
* **Built-in server and watch for changes**. With the built-in server you have a simple web server for viewing your site without any extra requirement. The new watch mode for `site:build` command enables to watch for changes and to regenerate your site automatically. See the [blog post](/news/2014/10/13/new-in-spress-1-1-built-in-server-and-watch-for-changes/).
* The new **IO API** enables to plugins for interact with the user. See the [blog post](/news/2014/05/11/new-in-spress-1-1-io-api/).
* Support for environment configurations. This is useful for writing configuration options for development and production environments. See the [blog post](/news/2014/06/12/new-in-spress-1-1-environment-configurations/).
* **Debug mode**. With this mode activated you can dump information about a template variable in your templates.
