Spress 1.0.3 is available with one [stability fix](https://github.com/yosymfony/Spress/issues/7) 
(thank you to **[@enzolutions](http://twitter.com/enzolutions)**) and 
[ConfigServiceProvider component](https://github.com/yosymfony/ConfigServiceProvider) updated to the
last version. Now Spress has support to 
**[.dist](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16843080/what-does-dist-used-as-an-extension-of-some-source-code-file-means) files**.

We are involved with the next Spress 1.1.0. Today the **[roadmap](https://github.com/yosymfony/Spress/issues/8)** was published.
